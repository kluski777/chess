# chess
A program made with a destination to track players moves to avoid any scams. Initially it was supposed to be a GUI app that would track players moves (that's why it returns exception when wrong coords are put in).
The app is not finished, lacks check function and checking where king can and can't move. Obviously lacks GUI as well.
